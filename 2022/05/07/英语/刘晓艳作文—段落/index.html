</ul>
<p>举例：<u>暴力游戏</u></p>
<p>If teenagers and youngsters spent more time playing violent video games, they would imitate these actions, becoming isolated from others. As a result, they would never communicate with others, which leads to more crimes committed by the young. In the end, there would be more worrying problems in our society.</p>
<p>举例：<u>Why students should be encouraged to develop effective communication skills.</u></p>
<p>If university students could develop effective communication skills, they could make more friends. In additio ns, the more friends they have, the more comfortable life they will have on campus. As a result, they will have a better learning environment, which consequently lead to a more harmonious context throughout the nation.</p>
<p>举例：<u>The use of translation apps</u></p>
<p>The more popular translation apps become, the more time will be saved, which thus results in the effciency of our work. That means more tasks could be completed in a certain period. As a consequence, Chinese economy will be boosted a lot.</p>

<p><u>the importance of mutual understanding and respect in interpersonal relationships.</u></p>
<p>In a dormitory, if every member could understand and respect each other, they might become more creative and effective in their study. In addition, it is such mutual understanding in interpersonal relationships that will result in a warm campus environment. In the end, there would be less conflict throughout our country.

<p>为什么孩子要远离暴力游戏？</p>
<p>Although there are numerous cases in our daily life, the following one is the most typical. I have a younger brother who was naughty but cute. When he was in primary school, he learned to play video games from his classmates. At the beginning, there no abnormal signs-He went to school normally and returned home normally. Suddenly, one day, he hurt one of his friends cruelly with a knife, which was incredible to all the families. This example effectively clarifies a truth that kids can be easy to imitate behaviors from these games, which might lead to serious consequences.</p>

<p>The popularity of online dictionaries, (<u>which really brings much convenience to the everyday life and study of youngsters,</u>) may be explained by many reasons. The main factor is that using online dictionaries can save us plenty of time, which proves to be in accord with people’s pursuit for higher efficiency. Then more importantly, (<u>it is so convenient for us to look up words on the web</u>) because we can efforlessly and rapidly find what we want by tapping words or phrases and the answer comes in no more than several seconds. So why bother to take a thick dictionary whenever or wherever?</p>
